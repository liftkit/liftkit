LiftKit has been developed as a framework for a proprietary CMS. It is currently lacking in documentation;
but its primary goals are flexability, testability, modularity, performance, and simplicity.

LiftKit denies the Convention-Over-Configuration paradigm, in favor of some of the virtues outlined above.
LiftKit is not opinionated.

This package serves as an outline of one potential configration for a project utilizing LiftKit. It is by
no means the only way to organize a project that utilizes the LiftKit libraries, but it does provide a 
template for a modular framework. There is an example submodule at https://github.com/liftkit/example-module,
which is included as a dependency of this package for demonstration's sake.

We have other libraries that are not included or demonstrated in this package, but may also be useful. 
Alternatively, LiftKit has been designed to play well with other packages.

Anyone interested in LiftKit should feel free contact me at rwilliams@stream9.net. I'd be glad to hear
your thoughts or field your questions.
