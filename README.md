LiftKit has been developed as a framework for a proprietary CMS.

This package serves as an outline of one potential configration for a project utilizing LiftKit. It is not 
the only way to organize a project that utilizes the LiftKit libraries, but it does provide a 
template for a modular framework. There is an example submodule at https://github.com/liftkit/example-module,
which is included as a dependency of this package for demonstration's sake.
